# NewCMS
Currently admin functionality only

This is a tryout to make a simple CMS using the Wordpress idea but adding the missing things like header and footer maintenance.
Furthermote using specific content blocks which can be displayed on any page just by relating them should make life easier
to show address details, images or certain banners which are not directly related to the content on the page itself.
